GEO.Itiniraries
===============
The GEO.Itiniraries system is made to show events happening nearby your geographical location. The location is fetched by using the HTML5 geolocation system.

Right now the system is in pre-alpha. A lot of styling is left to be done and also making mobile apps which can utilize the backend of the system as well.

The system is configured to run against the Azure Redis cache but the password is left out. The system can be configured to run against any Redis server out there by modifying the values in the web.config file.

Right now the only category it can show is the movies category.
But I am working on adding new features into apis.is to get new categories.

Feel free to fork the repository and issue a pull request if you feel the need to make some fixes.
